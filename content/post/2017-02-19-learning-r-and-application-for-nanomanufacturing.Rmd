This site is to share learning of R and its application to Semiconductor nanomanufacturing. The world we live in today is largely enabled by the electronics. The electronic ecosystem is over $1TB industry, with 1/5 of the business is semiconductor and its extended supply chain. 

The business can be well summed up as a inverted triangle. The semiconductor manufacturing, material and equipment are the supporting pilar of the industry. Citing a chart from Semi for the market size between 2014-2015.

The industry is driven aggressively with technology innovation and feed on data driven manufacturing process. This blog is to apply R and its package to solve some nanomanufacturing challenges. 

The planned format would includes:

- Problem statement
    + Technical challenge
    + Data analytical challenge
- Work flow
- Solution with R
    + Existing tools
    + New development
- Round up
