<p>This site is to share learning of R and its application to Semiconductor nanomanufacturing. The world we live in today is largely enabled by the electronics. The electronic ecosystem is over $1TB industry, with 1/5 of the business is semiconductor and its extended supply chain.</p>
<p>The business can be well summed up as a inverted triangle. The semiconductor manufacturing, material and equipment are the supporting pilar of the industry. Citing a chart from Semi for the market size between 2014-2015.</p>
<p>The industry is driven aggressively with technology innovation and feed on data driven manufacturing process. This blog is to apply R and its package to solve some nanomanufacturing challenges.</p>
<p>The planned format would includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Problem statement
<ul>
<li>Technical challenge</li>
<li>Data analytical challenge</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Work flow</li>
<li>Solution with R
<ul>
<li>Existing tools</li>
<li>New development</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Round up</li>
</ul>
